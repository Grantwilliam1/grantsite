                    <p>My name is Grant Young and I am a student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am a student in the CTD program, projected to graduate in spring 2025. I have interests in web developement/design and 3D modeling...</p>
                    <p>In terms of interests outside of school, I like to play video games, read manga, draw, and take long walks. My personal favorite games are the Persona, Pokemon, Kirby, and Hades (when Hades 2 comes out) series and my favorite manga are One Piece, Dandadan, and Dorohedoro. I also enjoy collecting video game merchandise (much to my wallet's dismay). I'm also close with my family, especially with my older brother and sister</p>
