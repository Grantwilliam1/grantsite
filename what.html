                <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
                <p>According to the University of Washington, Universal design refers to “the process of creating products that are accessible to people with a wide range of abilities, disabilities, and other characteristics”.<p>
                <p>Universal design is about making products that are usable by as many people as possible while limiting the need for adaptation, as opposed to regular design which mainly focuses on making products for an “average” user or market. Some examples of Universal Design on computers include being built for screen readers, or using strong color contrast to discern text from the body. Universal design allows for the user to navigate to site with as little issue as possible, regardless of whether the user has a disability or not.</p>

            <h3>The Seven Principles of Universal Design</h3>
            <p>There are seven determined key principles to Universal Design, which are applicable not only when designing websites, but offline as well. These principles are as follows:</p>
                <p><strong>Equitable Use:</strong> The design can be used by people with diverse abilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Flexibility in Use:</strong> The design can accommodate for individual preferences and abilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Simple and Intuitive Use:</strong> The design is easy to use and understand, regardless of knowledge, experience, language skills, and so on.</p>
                <p><strong>Perceptible Information:</strong> The design effectively conveys necessary information to the user, regardless of their own ability.</p>
                <p><strong>Tolerance for Error:</strong> The design minimizes the amount of hazards and consequences of unintentional action or mistakes.</p>
                <p><strong>Low Physical Effort:</strong> The design can be used while limiting the amount of effort required by the user.</p>
                <p><strong>Size and Space for Approach and use:</strong> The design provides the size and space for the user to approach, reach, manipulate, and use it regardless of their own ability.</p>

            <p>Researcher, professor, and author Donald Norman has also listed out several key design principles to keep in mind when designing anything, which can be extended into universal design. These principles include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visibility</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Feedback</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Constraints</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Mapping</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Consistency</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Affordance</strong></li>
            </ul>
