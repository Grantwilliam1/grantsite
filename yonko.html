                <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The Four Emperors, which constitute one of the Three Great Powers, are a group of four pirates considered to be the most notorious and powerful captains in the world. Currently, the Emperors are Red-Haired Shanks, Blackbeard, Straw Hat Luffy, and Buggy the Star Clown; Whitebeard, Big Mom, and Kaidou of the Beasts are the former known members.</p>
                    <p>The Four Emperors are not typically allies, nor are they strictly enemies of one another. Rather, the four prefer to remain autonomous under most circumstances. The Emperors have historically individually resided within the second half of the Grand Line (known as the "New World"), exerting impressive influence and control over dozens of other pirate crews and self-governing islands. Compared to antagonistic individuals and groups the Straw Hat Pirates faced earlier in the series, the Emperors serve as a far bigger threat during the second half of the One Piece series (most notably in the Whole Cake Island Saga and Wano Country Saga, where Big Mom and Kaidou serve as the respective main antagonists).</p>
                    <p>As an entity, the Four Emperors are one of the Three Great Powers of the world, the others being the Marines and the SSG (the latter replacing the now disbanded Seven Warlords of the Sea). Their strength and influence are such that they live quite literally as though they are sovereigns, doing mostly as they please as the "Emperors of the Sea"</p>
                    <p>Individually, the Emperors are usually considered to be the most powerful pirates in the world, with devastatingly powerful and versatile Devil Fruit abilities, immense physical prowess, a sheer mastery of Haki, or, most often, a combination of all three. Their individual bounties are among the highest in the world, with the lowest being 3,000,000,000 Berry and the highest (formerly) over 5,000,000,000 Berry. The only known pirates with comparable bounties to the Four Emperors are their greatest known rivals. The captain of the Heart Pirates: "Surgeon of Death" Trafalgar Law and the captain of the Kid Pirates: Eustass "Captain" Kid are Straw Hat Luffy's biggest rivals among the Worst Generation, having the same bounty as him; "Hawk Eyes" Dracule Mihawk was Red Hair Shanks' old swordsman rival before the latter lost an arm, and the Pirate King and captain of the Roger Pirates, Gol D. Roger, was Whitebeard's rival back when he was alive.</p>
